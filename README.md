# Rust-Api_Calls

In short, this code fetches a list of stargazers (users who have starred) a GitHub repository, deserializes the JSON response into structured Rust data, and prints out the list of users. It demonstrates how to make an HTTP request, 
handle the response, and work with JSON data using the reqwest and serde crates.
